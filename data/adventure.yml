    text: You are writing your first Rust program.  Do you choose to:
    actions:
      - text: rewrite it in Python
        target: 1
      - text: compile the code
        target: 2
  - id: 1
    text: You continue to live your ordinary life.  You have babies, grow old, and die.
  - id: 2
    text: The borrow checker complains.  How do you respond?
    actions:
      - text: Try adding some ampersands and muts to the code.
        target: 3
      - text: Clone the variable.
        target: 12
      - text: Run clippy
        target: 9
      - text: Use unsafe rust instead
        target: 10
  - id: 3
    text: You've tried something new.  This might work.
    actions:
      - text: Compile it again.
        target: 4
      - text: Revert all the changes and start over
        target: 0
  - id: 4
    text: The borrow checker complains again.  How do you respond?
      - text: Add some lifetime annotations.
        target: 5
      - text: Run clippy
        target: 9
      - text: Rewrite it in Java
        target: 1
      - text: Use unsafe code
        target: 10
  - id: 5
    text: You think the code looks pretty good now.
    actions:
      - text: Compile it again.
        target: 6
      - text: Revert all the changes and start over
        target: 0
  - id: 6
    text: The borrow checker is still complaining.  How do you proceed?
    actions:
      - text: Change the lifetime annotations again, and add some more ampersands.
        target: 7
      - text: Use unsafe code
        target: 10
      - text: Rewrite the whole thing in Ruby.
        target: 1
      - text: Run clippy
        target: 9
  - id: 7
    text: You're not quite sure what the code means anymore, but you're pretty sure you did everything the compiler asked you to do now.
    actions:
      - text: Compile it again.
        target: 8
  - id: 8
    text: The code compiles!  You have successfully written a Rust program, but you find the language a little confusing.  Maybe it will be easier next time.
  - id: 9
    text: Clippy spits out a number of suggestions that help you understand not only what isn't working, but how you could write your code more idiomatically.  After reading the suggestions, you understand why your code wasn't working 
    actions:
      - text: Compile it again.
        target: 11
      - text: Use unsafe code, just for fun.
        target: 10
  - id: 10
    text: You have been eaten by a wild segmentation fault.
  - id: 11
    text: The code compiles!  The program runs blazingly fast, and uses clean and idiomatic rust. You go out and tell all your friends that they should rewrite all their code in Rust. 
  - id: 12
    text: The code compiles!  You think you could make it faster without all the .clone() calls around your code, but hey! it's still faster than Python.
